# municipal

municipals can range from small villages with only a handful of people to large cities with hundreds of thousands.  only cities will be named, but the surrounding towns and villages will be counted as part of the city's population and named with the city and a unique number as the suffix e.g. handan:town:1

land should be segmented, a village will have lots for houses, buildings, or farms.  each of the lots can be rented out.

taxes must be collected by the officials of each municipality while this then gets collected by the state, failure to pay these taxes may end in being put in jail.
