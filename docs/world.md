# world

congqian is a living and breathing world, things are constantly changing and everyone has an opportunity to change the course of the world.  in order to simulate such a world, npc's must fully interact with the congqian world like normal players.  events happen as a result of these changes, an example is whether you choose to live a just life or a life of corruption, these things will impact the population, society, and ultimately could lead to revolution.  congqian world is full of choices, you can take on a job in government if you so possess the minimal requirements, you could also choose to do nothing and wander around the world farming, building, and collecting materials.  join the military, become a merchant, live a life as an outlaw, or join a barbarian tribe, each decision impacts your future so choose wisely.

players never die, this is the continuum of congqian that allows you to play the game for a long time.  progress in the ladder and you can unlock different types of game play, for example, work your way up from a foot soldier to a general, the things that you will be able to control as a general will be much more than as a soldier.  the higher you go, the bigger the impact you can make to the world of congqian.
