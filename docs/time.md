# time

the congqian world is a continuous, shared time, everything that happens changes the history of the game, everyone is on the same time, missions come and go, if you miss a mission, you don't go back and play it again.  time will follow actual time, but consists of a single time zone.  at the end of each day, a rate of costs and income will be calculated and provided to the player.  in order to compress time, each day will consist of 4-6h, so things will move 3 times faster than actual time, 3h that have passed in the congqian world will be 1h in real time.

really hate those games where you either pay or wait for tasks to complete.  games shouldn't require waiting, i want to play and i want to play now.  this is just a vice for people to spend money, but i think there are other less conniving ways of earning money.  the game is for players, the game play is fun and doesn't require paying to play.
