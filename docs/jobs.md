_more jobs to be added over time_

### peasant

every player starts as a peasant, the basic needs are food, water, and shelter, these can be obtained through various means i.e. they can either be bought or produced.  players will be placed in a random plot of land with a random amount of money where they will need to pay a weekly rate for the usage of the land.  if players cannot pay these amounts, they will be removed from the land.  this land can be used to grow vegetables or raise livestock.

there is a general rate for which things grow which allows people to sell these in markets, this differs for each type of food.

this is a fairly cruel existence and earnings will be minimalized due to land leaseand taxes on any earnings.

### servant

servants basically have free housing and meals, and do not need to provide quota, just help their masters, they receive little pay because of the nature of the work that they need to perform.


### soldiers

especially in this time period of constant war, there is a high demand for qualified soldiers, so this is generally a good occupation with steady pay.  each kingdom has a different promotion mechanism, but similar ranks, so rising in the ranks can lead to more pay.  the only risk is severe injury and/or death, but since congqian allows players to revive, this makes joining the military a good choice for a profession.

to become a soldier, you must be a male and between a certain age range.  this age range varies per kingdom which may be adjusted on a whim based on the kingdom's need for army and funding.

### civil servant

this is a government sanctioned role to administer a municipal.  to gain such a position requires certain levels of intelligence, skill, and potentially a recommendation.  there are many different roles as a civil servant, the magistrate is the highest level for a municipal and governs everything from taxation, military draft, settlements, land, budgeting, municipal development, public works, police, records management, food storage, etc.  this is generally a desirable role with limited capacity and provides lots of advancement opportunities.

### merchant

purely selling of goods and services, requires a little bit of capital to get involved like renting land for a shop, paying employees, but there's no requirements otherwise in terms of skills.  this is an easy way to increase wealth though merchants are subject to taxation, leasing agreements, competition, etc.


### artisan

artisans provide a certain service like carpentry, cooking, cleaning, entertainment, etc.  each municipal will have varying degrees of need for artisans based on
