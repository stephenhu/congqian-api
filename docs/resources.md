# resources

in general, resources will change over time so there needs to be a decoupling of these
resources from the source code, resources should persist outside of code.

animals are a special type of resource in that they have several properties, they can
reproduce, be leveraged for their parts like animal hides, can produce food products like
milk or eggs, and/or as a direct primary food type.
