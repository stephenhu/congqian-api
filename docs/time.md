# time

the congqian world is a continuous, shared time, everything that happens changes the history of the game, everyone is on the same time scale, missions come and go, if you miss a mission, you don't go back and play it again.  

really hate those games where you either pay or wait for tasks to complete.  games shouldn't require waiting, i want to play and i want to play now.  this is just a vice for people to spend money, but i think there are other less conniving ways of earning money.  the game is for players, the game play is fun and doesn't require paying to play.
